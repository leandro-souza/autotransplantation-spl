                               <p class="justifyText">For companies producing related products, Software Product Lines (SPL) is a software reuse method that improves time-to-market and software quality, achieving substantial cost reductions. These benefits do not come for free. It often takes years to rearchitect and reengineer a codebase to support SPL and, once adopted, it must be maintained. Current SPL practice rely on a collection of tools, tailored for different reengineering phases, whose output developers must coordinate and integrate. We present Foundry, a general automated approach for leveraging software transplantation to speed conversion to and maintenance of SPL. Foundry facilitates feature extraction. It can efficiently, repeatedly, transplant a sequence of features, implemented in multiple files. 
                               </p>
                               
                               <p class="about-para-middle">We realised FOUNDRY in prodScalpel, a software transplantation tool for SPL that 
                               facilitates feature identification and can efficiently transplant a multi-organ, i.e., a sequence of features. 
                               We used prodScalpel to create two product lines and derive two products that contain features from three real-world 
                               systems each. We also compared it with manual effort, showing that prodScalpel is able to migrate features 
                               between different codebases within 4 hours, time limit within which expert SPL developers have not finished the task. 
                               When the same codebase for the host and the donor was used, prodScalpel was able to migrate a feature within an 
                               average of 48min, compared to an average of 1h21min of developer effort.

                             <p>Here we present an overview of <i>FOUNDRY</i>’s workflow.  it applies software transplantation idea to re-engineering of product lines from existing systems. Foundry is independent of the programming language, and supports SPL’s <i>domain engineering</i> and <i>application engineering</i> [3] processes at the code level.
                             Given organs’ entry points for each organ in the donor systems, their target implantation points in the product base, 
                             and a set of test suites that exercise each organ, it automatically: extracts a set of organs; constructs an organ-host compatibility layer; trans-forms each organ to be compatible with the context of their targetsites in the product base; and implants them in 
                             the beneficiary’senvironment. All product generation processes are performed in an iterative 
                             way where each organ is transplanted stepwise, and a new product is incrementally constructed 
                             as each organ is successfully transplanted.

                             <p>Based on software transplantation idea, Foundry treats product base and over-organs (representing features) as product line assets. A product base is a host that contains all features that will be shared among the products. An over-organ, in turn, is a completely functional and reusable portion of code extracted from a donor system that conservatively over-approximates the target organ [1]. An over-organ can be specialized to became an organ that preserves the original behavior of the feature in a different host environmen [1].

                             Conceptually, in Foundry, while the product base provides commonalities (i.e., common features) to the target product line, the variability (i.e., variant features) are provided by the transplantation process, as illustrated in Figure 2. This idea opens new ways for SPLE area by automated construction of different products by transplanting multiple organs into a product base.

                             <h5>Domain Engineering</h5>
                             <p><strong>Preoperative Stage:</strong> As in medicine, Foundry has a preoperative stage where donors and the host are prepared for the transplantation process and a postoperative stage where we evaluate if the transplantation was successful (see Section 3.2 for more details on the postoperative stage). The preoperative stage defines pre-transplantation tasks, responsible for the variability analysis process, the organ’s test suite, donor and host preparation.
                             </p>
                             <br>
                             
                             <p><strong>Over-organ Extraction:</strong>  Once the donor is prepared, it is possible to start the over-organ extraction process. In this stage, all source code related to the organ to be transplanted, that implements the target feature, must be identified and extracted. As in previous work, we use backward and forward slicing to achieve this task [1]. At the end of the extraction process, the source code of the over-organ is then stored in the transplantation platform, together with other over-organs that compose the product line. All over-organs in the platform are available to be reused during the application engineering process.
                             </p> 
                             <br>
                             
                             <h5>Application Engineering</h5>

                             <p><strong>Over-organ Selection:</strong>  Over-organ Selection. At the start of the transplantation process, an SPL engineer selects the target features that will be transplanted into the product base to create the target product. The choice is guided by the feature model generated during the variability analysis process, so as, to support the SPL engineer to handle eventual relationship and restrictions among transplanted organs. Once the target feature is chosen in the feature model, it is possible to find the corresponding over-organ in the transplantation platform.
                             </p>
                             <br>
                             <p><strong>Over-organ Reduction and Adaptation:</strong> The over-organ reduction and adaptation processes using genetic programming (GP). GP reduces an over-organ and specialises it to the host environment. It thus creates an organ that preserves the original behaviour of the feature at a given insertion point in the host environment. <i>FOUNDRY</i> supports the adaptation of an organ that contains multiple files. Foundry introduces an organ-host wrapper. This layer is responsible for providing access to the organ from the target host. It is automatically constructed on demand, according to a given implantation point in the product base.</p>
                             <br>
                            
                             <p><strong>Organ Implantation:</strong>   In this stage of the process, the organ is ready to be implanted into the product base. <i>FOUNDRY</i> handles the transplantation of multiple organs into a single host and its consequent dependency and interactions, while avoid code duplication. <i>FOUNDRY</i> solves these challenges by using code clone detection. To avoid duplicated code insertion, <i>FOUNDRY</i> checks whether a specific code element is already present in the host, considering not only its namespace but its structure and context at a fine level of granularity to make sure that two portions of code are "clones".</p>
                             <br>
                            
                             <p><strong>Postoperative Stage:</strong>  As in medicine, <i>FOUNDRY</i> requires checking the side-effects of the transplantation operation. 
                             For this, we have to perform regression and acceptance testing in the post-operative product base.After the postoperative stage, new iterations of organ transplantation can be performed; thus, in a stepwise and incremental way, a new product is derived as organs are transplanted into a product base</p>

                            <p class="justifyText">Currently, Foundry is realized in a software transplantation tool for SPL re-engeineering called <i>ProdScalpel</i>. The <i>ProdScalpel</i> facilitates feature identification and can efficiently transplant a multi-organ, i.e., a sequence of features. The tool have been developed from 𝜇Scalpel [1] with focus on the transplantation of multiple organs and their implantation into a single codebase. This innovation opens the way to automated software transplantation process for SPLE, since it will enable companies to reuse features from existing codebases in an automated way. Figure 8 shows the overall architecture of the prodScalpel tool.

 						<p class="justifyText"> Aiming to assess Foundry with respect to human effort, we conducted We conducted an experiment that reflects a real-world process of product line migration from existing codebases [2]. The goal of this experiment is to analyse the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach compared with the manual process of generating a product line from existing systems, performed by SPL experts.

                        We answer our research questions by simulating a real reengineering process where two features must be transferred to a product line built over a product base.  
                        
                        In scenario I, we gathered a group of 10 SPL experts (called Group A) where each one of them had to manually re-transplant all portions of code that implement the feature <i>dir_init</i> to the product base. We removed this feature from the original version of <i>NEATVI</i> to generate the product base used in this scenario. In scenario II, another group of 10 SPL experts (called Group B) tried to insert the feature write_archive from <i>MYTAR</i> into the original version of <i>NEATVI</i> used as the product base. 

                        We recruited 20 SPL experts for the experiment that were divided into two different groups.</p>

						<p class="justifyText"> We created two groups (A and B) with similar background distribution of participants. Table shows the details of 
                       	the participants involved in the experiment. Group A simulated the first scenario by transplanting a 
                             feature from a codebase different to the host one. Group B simulated the second scenario by transplanting a feature 
                             from the same codebase as the host.</p>

We report the status of the product base and feature inserted by the participants, the time spent and the number of passing tests for the regression augmented regression and acceptance test suites. In the first scenario, only one of the participants was not able to finish the process before the timeout. On the other hand, half of the participants were able to finish the process before achieving the timeout in the second scenario and only three of them have been able to insert the target feature without breaking the product base.

Most of the participants from Group B had not completed the feature migration process from Mytar within the 4 hours time limit. Considering the participants that were able to finish the process (i.e., participants P17, P18 and P19)successfully (all tests passed) they spent an average of 2h23 minutes while prodScalpel was able to complete this task in 19 of 20 trials in the timeout, taking 27 minutes on average.

                             To facilitate replicating our results, we have written a sequence of scripts that run a *single* run of each of our scenario. 
                             The name of the script identifies the scenario. We have worked hard to make each script bullet-proof and have it thoroughly check your environment for its dependencies and tell you what, if anything, is missing. Despite our best efforts, you may still encounter problems. If that happens, please contact us so we can work with you to resolve them.</p>  <br>  
                             <p class="justifyText"> This artifact contains the tool prodScalpel, which was used for autotransplantation. Also we provide our regression, augmented regression, and acceptance test suites, where possible. In the other cases these test suites were executed manually (for GUI programs or the Webserver), or the original regression test suite was not executing at all the organ.

                             To establish the time for feature transplantation using our automated approach, we ran prodScalpel 20 times, and measure the average time spent on feature migration in each scenario. This average time was compared with the time spent by our participants on the manual re-engineering proces.
